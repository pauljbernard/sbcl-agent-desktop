# Getting Started

This guide is for developers and engineers using Surface.

If you are new to environment-first or agentic development, do not start here.

Start with:

1. [Development Model](development-model.md)
2. [How sbcl-agent Works](how-sbcl-agent-works.md)
3. [sbcl-agent Concepts](sbcl-agent-concepts.md)
4. [Transition Guide](transition-guide.md)

Then come back to this page for practical setup.

## What You Need

- macOS
- the `sbcl-agent-ux` repository
- Node.js and npm
- an available `sbcl-agent` environment if you want live integration

## Run Surface

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Live Integration Basics

If you want `Surface` to connect to a real `sbcl-agent` environment, set the live adapter environment variables before launch.

Typical pipe-backed launch:

```bash
SBCL_AGENT_ADAPTER=live
SBCL_AGENT_TRANSPORT=pipe
SBCL_AGENT_PROJECT_DIR=../sbcl-agent
npm run dev
```

The live adapter will default the persisted environment state path if `SBCL_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATE_PATH` is not provided.

For more detail, including socket-backed launch, see [Live Connection](live-connection.md).

## First Launch

On first launch, expect three things:

1. the `Surface` frame appears with the navigation rail, header, workspace canvas, inspector, and footer
2. `Surface` may start in mock-backed mode if a live host is not configured
3. some workspaces will show placeholder or mock environment content until a live host is bound

When live mode is working correctly, `Surface` is attached to one self-hosted introspective environment runtime. Browser, Conversations, Execution, Recovery, and Configuration are then all projections over the same environment identity.

The current desktop shell looks like this:

## Mock Mode Vs Live Mode

`Surface` has two main host-adapter modes:

- `mock`: useful for UI evaluation and UX iteration
- `live`: intended to connect the desktop to a real `sbcl-agent` host

If you are unsure which one you are in, check the footer and the visible host/binding posture in the `Surface` frame.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [Development Model](development-model.md)
2. [How sbcl-agent Works](how-sbcl-agent-works.md)
3. [sbcl-agent Concepts](sbcl-agent-concepts.md)
4. [Transition Guide](transition-guide.md)
5. [Desktop Tour](desktop-tour.md)
6. [Browser](browser.md)
7. [Conversations](conversations.md)
8. [Execution](execution.md)
9. [Recovery](recovery.md)
10. [Evidence](evidence.md)
11. [Configuration](configuration.md)

## Common First Tasks

- browse systems, packages, symbols, and source in [Browser](browser.md)
- inspect governed project posture in [Projects And Context](projects-and-context.md)
- inspect or resume structured work in [Conversations](conversations.md)
- use the listener and inspect runtime results in [Execution](execution.md)
- review incidents and recovery obligations in [Recovery](recovery.md)
- inspect artifacts and event history in [Evidence](evidence.md)

That order is intentional. It follows the environment-first operating model:

1. inspect the live runtime
2. understand conversation and workflow continuity
3. act through governed execution
4. verify evidence, incident posture, and recovery state

## If The App Looks Wrong

Go to [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) first. Common issues are renderer staleness, theme mismatch, unbound environment state, or a live-host transport problem.
