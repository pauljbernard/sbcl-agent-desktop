# Recovery

The Recovery workspace is where incident posture and restoration obligations become explicit.

Use it when the environment is degraded, interrupted, or carrying recovery work that must be resolved before execution can be trusted again.

Recovery is part of the governance model, not an external aftercare process. Incident posture, replay, validation burden, and resumable continuation are all native parts of the same self-hosted environment.

## What You Can Do Here

- review open incidents
- inspect severity and recovery state
- read recovery summary and next action
- inspect linked runtime and artifact context
- inspect linked work-item, project, and workflow posture
- understand whether the environment can safely resume execution

## Page Structure

Recovery follows the same workspace pattern:

1. incident list or primary recovery table first
2. selected incident detail below
3. linked context and evidence below that

## When To Use Recovery

Go here when:

- a turn fails
- runtime state is degraded
- evidence indicates unresolved recovery obligations
- workflow closure is blocked by incident posture

## Goal

Recovery is complete only when the environment can return to execution without hidden obligations.

That now includes project and workflow obligations, not only raw runtime stability. A system can be technically alive while still carrying blocked governed work, unresolved readiness obligations, or contradictory project/workflow posture that should prevent confident continuation.
