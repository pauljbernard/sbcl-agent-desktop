# Configuration

The Configuration workspace is where `Surface` exposes desktop preferences and presentation-level behavior.

It is intentionally about how the self-hosted environment is projected and operated, not about redefining the environment itself. Runtime, workflow, approvals, and evidence remain environment concerns; Configuration controls how those surfaces are displayed and navigated.

## Preferences

The first configuration surface is `Preferences`.

Current preference areas include:

- theme selection
- system, light, and dark theme behavior
- Lisp code-view color settings
- desktop-surface presentation scaling
- shell chrome and code-surface readability preferences

## Theme System

`Surface` supports:

- `System`
- `Light`
- `Dark`

`System` follows the host operating-system theme when available.

## Lisp Code View

`Surface` includes a configurable Lisp source view with:

- formatted source display
- parenthesis depth colorization
- adjustable colors by nesting depth

This is useful when working with Browser source views and any other code-oriented surfaces in the desktop.

## Desktop Surface

`Surface` also exposes shell-surface preferences for how the application reads at a distance.

Current desktop-surface controls include values such as:

- tooltip scale
- control icon scale
- dock icon scale
- conversation text scale
- source-code text scale

These settings matter because `Surface` is now a denser shell with rails, floating panels, and multiple concurrent surfaces rather than a single narrow page view.

## Goal

Configuration should make `Surface` easier to operate without turning preferences into a second engineering domain.
