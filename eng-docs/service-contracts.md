# Service Contracts

## Purpose

This document defines the frontend-facing service contract model for the `Surface` macOS application.

The point is not to finalize transport details. The point is to define stable service responsibilities and contract shapes so Surface does not couple itself to shell internals, compatibility-session helpers, or ad hoc struct reads.

## Service Architecture Rule

The service boundary sits between:

1. the `sbcl-agent` environment kernel
2. the desktop presentation layer

The shell and Surface should both become clients of the same governed services.

## Contract Rules

### Rule 1: Query And Command Separation

Each service family should separate:

- queries for stable inspection
- commands for governed mutation
- events for live observation

### Rule 2: Commands Carry Governance

Mutation commands must:

- pass through policy
- emit durable operation and workflow evidence
- surface approval requirements explicitly
- preserve linkage to turn, work-item, incident, or runtime context where relevant

### Rule 3: Events Are Canonical

Surface should observe system change through canonical service events, not through transcript parsing or private runtime polling tricks.

### Rule 4: Environment Is The Context Root

Every service contract should be environment-scoped unless there is a strong reason otherwise.

## Shared Contract Shape

### Query Contract

Queries should accept:

- `environment-id`
- entity identifiers where relevant
- optional filters
- optional pagination or cursor fields

Queries should return:

- stable DTOs
- relationship references
- posture summaries where useful
- no shell-specific rendering assumptions
- explicit authority and binding metadata where the backend already exposes them

### Command Contract

Commands should accept:

- `environment-id`
- actor context
- target identifiers
- command payload
- optional linked thread, turn, work-item, or incident context

Commands should return:

- accepted, rejected, or awaiting-approval result
- created or affected entity references
- operation identifiers
- next-action hints for Surface
- project-selection hints when project context materially shapes the command
- recovery or replay hints when the command touches resumable workflow state

### Event Contract

Events should expose:

- environment-scoped cursor
- event family
- event kind
- timestamp
- primary entity reference
- related thread, turn, operation, work-item, incident, or artifact references
- visibility
- structured payload
- actor-origin and recovery or replay annotations where the backend event stream exposes them

## Service Families

Purpose:

- orient the user to the environment as a whole

Primary queries:

- `get-environment-summary`

## Cross-Service Design Requirements

### Relationship References

DTOs should consistently include references to:

- `environment-id`
- `thread-id`
- `turn-id`
- `operation-id`
- `work-item-id`
- `workflow-record-id`
- `artifact-id`
- `incident-id`
- `task-id`
- `worker-id`
- `project-id`

### Attention Semantics

Each query model should make it possible for Surface to determine whether an item is:

- active
- waiting
- blocked
- failed
- interrupted
- completed

### Explanation Fields

Where the kernel already has governance reasoning, the service layer should expose concise explanatory fields rather than forcing Surface to synthesize them from raw payloads.

Examples:

- why approval is required
- why a work-item is blocked
- why an incident is still open
- why a runtime mutation still awaits colder validation
- why a project selection is explicit, inferred, or low-confidence
- why capability posture is degraded or missing prerequisites

## Event Subscription Contract

Surface should consume a service-level event stream compatible with the current cursor-based environment event contract.

Minimum contract:

- `environment-id`
- optional `after-cursor`
- optional family filter
- optional visibility filter
- bounded result limit
- returned ordered events
- returned `next-cursor`

This contract should support:

- polling now
- push delivery later

without changing desktop domain behavior.

## Out Of Scope

This document intentionally does not yet define:

- HTTP, local socket, or IPC transport
- auth protocol implementation details
- serialization format details
- exact DTO field names

Those should be decided after the desktop architecture and integration strategy are specified.
