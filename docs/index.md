# Surface

`Surface` is the macOS application for developers and engineers working inside an `sbcl-agent` environment.

This site is the user-facing documentation for operating the desktop.

It is not the engineering specification set for building Surface itself. The engineering design documents live in the repository under `eng-docs/` and are best read from GitHub:

- [Engineering Constitution](https://github.com/pauljbernard/sbcl-agent-desktop/blob/master/eng-docs/constitution.md)
- [Desktop Shell And Control-Panel Model](https://github.com/pauljbernard/sbcl-agent-desktop/blob/master/eng-docs/desktop-shell-and-control-panel-model.md)
- [Design System](https://github.com/pauljbernard/sbcl-agent-desktop/blob/master/eng-docs/design-system.md)

## What The Desktop Is

The desktop is a service-backed environment workspace, not a file browser with chat attached.

It is designed to help you work across:

- the live Common Lisp image
- structured conversations with agents
- governed execution and approvals
- incidents, evidence, and reconciliation
- source, runtime, and workflow context at the same time

## Current Desktop Snapshot

The current `Surface` desktop looks like this in practice:

## What Changed Recently

The desktop now supports a stronger shell model than the older documentation implied:

- left and right rails can be collapsed, expanded, and resized
- each rail can host multiple docked panels
- docked rail panels are selected from compact rail lists instead of oversized horizontal tabs
- panels can be undocked into floating windows in the central stage
- floating panels can be docked back to either the left or right rail

If a page elsewhere in the site still describes the older shell too loosely, prefer the current behavior of the running `Surface` application.

## Start Here

1. Read [Development Model](development-model.md).
2. Read [How sbcl-agent Works](how-sbcl-agent-works.md).
3. Read [sbcl-agent Concepts](sbcl-agent-concepts.md).
4. Read [Transition Guide](transition-guide.md).
5. Read [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
6. Take the [Desktop Tour](desktop-tour.md).
7. Go directly to the workspace guide you need:
   - [Browser](browser.md)
   - [Conversations](conversations.md)
   - [Execution](execution.md)
   - [Recovery](recovery.md)
   - [Evidence](evidence.md)
   - [Configuration](configuration.md)
8. If you are connecting the desktop to a real host, read [Live Connection](live-connection.md).
9. If something is wrong, go to [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and [FAQ](faq.md).

## Core Operating Model

The desktop assumes:

- the environment is the root object, not a transcript and not a file tree
- runtime inspection is first-class
- conversation is durable, but it is not the only control surface
- approvals, incidents, work-items, and artifacts are engineering objects, not secondary metadata

The deeper architectural references behind this site now center on five things:

- the actor model
- the concurrency and execution model
- the governance model
- context integration
- the self-hosted introspective environment runtime

## Backend Validation Baseline

`Surface` is only trustworthy when the host runtime underneath it is also being validated honestly.

The current backend validation set now includes:

- `./bin/sbcl-agent doctor`
- `./bin/run-concurrency-regression`
- `./bin/run-concurrency-performance`
- `./bin/run-actor-system-regression`
- `./bin/run-actor-system-performance`

Current documented baseline during this rebaseline:

- backend health passed
- concurrency regression passed
- actor-system regression passed
- actor-system performance passed
- concurrency performance has one active enforced-budget miss on mixed-load actor dispatch latency

For details, use the backend docs:

- [`sbcl-agent` Testing Coverage Analysis](../../sbcl-agent/docs/testing-coverage-analysis.md)
- [`sbcl-agent` Validation Strategy](../../sbcl-agent/docs/validation-strategy.md)

## Canonical vs Historical Architecture References

When this site points back to `sbcl-agent`, prefer these as the canonical current references:

- [Architecture](../../sbcl-agent/docs/architecture.md)
- [Actor Runtime, Concurrency, And Governance](../../sbcl-agent/docs/robust-actor-kernel-architecture.md)
- [Context Engineering](../../sbcl-agent/docs/context-engineering.md)
- [Conversation Runtime](../../sbcl-agent/docs/conversation-architecture.md)

Treat these as historical or origin-context references instead:

- [Historical Baseline Assessment](../../sbcl-agent/docs/agentos-current-state-gap-analysis.md)
- [Historical IntentOS Target Architecture](../../sbcl-agent/docs/agentos-target-state-architecture.md)
- [IntentOS Constitution](../../sbcl-agent/docs/intentos-constitution.md)
- [Kernel Invariants](../../sbcl-agent/docs/kernel-invariants.md)
