# Browser

The Browser workspace is the live-system browser for the `sbcl-agent` environment.

It is the closest thing in the desktop to a Common Lisp image browser:

- systems
- packages
- symbols
- variables
- classes and methods
- runtime objects
- source
- xref
- documentation
- governance and linked conversations

## What The Browser Is For

Use Browser when you need to inspect the living system directly rather than reason from files alone.

Browser is the clearest day-to-day expression of the self-hosted introspective runtime. It is where the environment exposes loaded systems, packages, symbols, objects, and linked governed context as live engineering state rather than as reconstructed guesses from files alone.

Typical tasks:

- find a loaded system
- inspect a package and its visible symbols
- inspect a function, variable, class, or generic function
- view source attached to runtime entities
- explore callers, methods, or semantic references
- review documentation or governance linkage for a selected entity

## How The Pages Work

Each Browser subpage follows the same structure:

1. a searchable, sortable, pageable table at the top
2. selected-row detail below
3. actions and supporting context below that

## Source Viewing

Source panels in Browser are Lisp-aware:

- code is formatted for readability
- parentheses are colorized by depth
- the view is vertically scrollable
- editor-symbol context can be surfaced alongside the browser work without shifting the main source panel itself

Parenthesis color settings are available in [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Recommended Workflow

1. start in `Systems` to confirm the loaded environment
2. move into `Packages` or `Symbols`
3. inspect detail and source
4. jump into `XREF` or `Documentation`
5. use linked context to move into Conversations, Execution, or Evidence as needed
6. keep the browser as the live semantic inspection surface rather than falling back immediately to file browsing

## Important Distinction

Browser is not a detached file tree.

It is a semantic browser over a live Lisp environment and its governed context.
