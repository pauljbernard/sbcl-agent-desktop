# Troubleshooting

## The Desktop Starts But Data Looks Mocked

Possible causes:

- the app is running in mock mode
- the live host adapter is not configured
- the environment is not bound
- the renderer and live environment binding drifted apart

Check:

- host posture in the footer
- binding posture in the footer
- environment identity visible in Browser or Operate

## A Page Looks Stale After A Refactor

Possible causes:

- Electron renderer hot reload did not repaint cleanly
- a previous dev session is still running

What to do:

1. stop the current Electron process
2. restart with `npm run dev`
3. re-open the relevant workspace

## A Workspace Looks Like A Dashboard Instead Of A Working Surface

That is usually a layout regression.

The intended pattern is:

- main table or primary execution surface first
- selected detail or result directly below
- secondary context after that

## Browser Data Is Empty

Possible causes:

- no live environment is bound
- mock data is active
- the live adapter is not yet wired to the needed service path

In live mode, also check whether the Browser surface is showing the expected environment identity. Browser often reveals binding-health problems earlier than conversation or workflow surfaces because it reads directly from the introspective runtime.

## Listener Or Inspector Does Not Behave Correctly

Check:

- current package
- active transport mode
- whether the host bridge is live
- whether the symbol/package inputs are populated correctly

## Approval, Work, Or Recovery Looks Empty

Possible causes:

- the current environment simply has no active governed records
- mock state does not include the scenario you expect
- the live service host is not supplying the relevant domain yet

Because these surfaces are actor- and governance-driven, “empty” can also mean the live environment currently has no active approval, work, or incident state. Check whether the environment is healthy before assuming the UI is broken.

## Theme Looks Partly Wrong

Possible causes:

- theme changed but renderer did not fully refresh
- some components still carry outdated color rules

Try:

1. toggle between Light, Dark, and System
2. restart the desktop if needed
