# Live Connection

The desktop can run in mock mode or connect to a real `sbcl-agent` host.

In live mode, the desktop is not talking to a thin stateless API. It is attaching to a self-hosted introspective environment runtime. That means connection health depends on both transport health and binding correctness: the desktop, actor runtime, execution services, and live environment all need to agree on the current environment identity.

## Modes

- `mock`: useful for UI development and UX review
- `live`: intended to talk to a real environment host

## Typical Live Environment Variables

Socket-based launch:

```bash
SBCL_AGENT_ADAPTER=live
SBCL_AGENT_TRANSPORT=socket
SBCL_AGENT_SOCKET_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:4017
npm run dev
```

Pipe-based launch:

```bash
SBCL_AGENT_ADAPTER=live
SBCL_AGENT_TRANSPORT=pipe
SBCL_AGENT_PROJECT_DIR=../sbcl-agent
npm run dev
```

Optional live-adapter variables:

- `SBCL_AGENT_PROJECT_DIR`: path to the `sbcl-agent` repository used by the pipe bridge
- `SBCL_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATE_PATH`: explicit path for the persisted live environment state file
- `SBCL_AGENT_PIPE_COMMAND`: optional pipe command override when you are not using the default local bridge flow

## What To Check First

- host posture in the footer
- binding posture in the footer
- whether the environment is mock-backed or live-backed
- whether Browser, Projects, Conversations, and Execution surfaces are returning real data
- whether environment and project posture reflects the live backend rather than fallback mock content

## If The Connection Fails

Go to [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

In practice, most failures come from:

- host process not running
- wrong transport mode
- wrong socket endpoint or pipe command
- environment not bound yet
